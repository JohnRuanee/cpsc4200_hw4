Start by running `./build.sh` to set up your targets. It will prompt 
for usernames. Enter all usernames in your group, separated by spaces.
Each groupâ€™s targets will be slightly different, so make sure your
usernames are correct!

We've provided `test.sh` to help check that your solutions match
the spec. However, this script is not the final grading script,
and it is not authoritative. The spec (and final grading script)
have a few requirements beyond what the script verifies, and it's
up to you to test carefully.
